Reuben Clark —</p></blockquote></div><h1><em>Introduction</em></h1><p>[Name of CES Director Removed],</p><p>Thank you for responding to my grandfather’s request to answer my concerns and questions and for offering your time with me. I appreciate it.</p><p>I’m interested in your thoughts and answers as I have been unable to find official answers from the Church for most of these issues. I’m hoping you’re going to have better answers than many of the ones given by unofficial apologists such as FAIR and Neal Maxwell Institute (formerly FARMS).</p><p>I’m just going to be straightforward and blunt in sharing my concerns. Obviously I’m a disaffected member who lost his testimony so it’s no secret which side I’m on at the moment. All this information is a result of over a year of intense research and an absolute rabid obsession with Joseph Smith and Church history. With this said, I’d be pretty arrogant and ignorant to say that I have all the information and that you don’t have answers. Like you, I put my pants on one leg at a time and I see through a glass darkly. You may have new information and/or a new perspective that I may not have heard or considered before. This is why I’m genuinely interested in what your answers and thoughts are to these troubling problems.</p><p>I’ve decided to lay down just about all the major concerns that I have. I went through my notes from my past year of research and compiled them together. It doesn’t make sense for me to just lay down 5 concerns while I also have 20 other legitimate concerns that are keeping me from believing the truth claims of the LDS Church.</p><p>A quick background might be helpful as to where I’m coming from. I was a very active and fully believing member my entire life up until around the summer of 2012. My grandpa already outlined my life events to you in his email so I think you get the idea that I accepted and embraced Mormonism.</p><p>In February of 2012, I was reading the news online when I came across the following news article: <a href=./local/www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/31/us-mormonchurch-idUSTRE80T1CM20120131.html title=http://www.reuters.com/article/2012/01/31/us-mormonchurch-idUSTRE80T1CM20120131 target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Mormonism Besieged by the Modern Age</a>. In the article was information about a Q&amp;A meeting at Utah State University that LDS Church Historian and General Authority, Elder Marlin K. Jensen gave in late 2011. He was asked his thoughts regarding the effects of Google on membership and people who are “leaving in droves” over Church history.</p><p>Elder Marlin K. Jensen’s response:</p><blockquote><p>“Maybe since Kirtland, we’ve never had a period of—I’ll call it apostasy, like we’re having now; largely over these issues…”</p></blockquote><p>This truly shocked me. I didn’t understand what was going on or why people would leave “over history.” I started doing research and reading books like LDS historian and scholar Richard Bushman’s <em><a href=./local/www.amazon.com/Joseph-Smith-Rough-Stone-Rolling/dp/1400077532.html title=http://www.amazon.com/Joseph-Smith-Rough-Stone-Rolling/dp/1400077532 target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Rough Stone Rolling</a></em> and many others to try to better understand what was happening.</p><p>The following issues are among my main concerns:</p><h1><em>Book of Mormon</em> Concerns &amp; Questions:</h1><ol><li><p>What are 1769 King James Version edition <a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/w/The_Book_of_Mormon_and_the_King_James_Bible.html#Perpetuation_of_translation_errors title="http://en.wikipedia.org/w/index.php?title=The_Book_of_Mormon_and_the_King_James_Bible&amp;oldid=582211861#Perpetuation_of_translation_errors" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>errors</a> doing in the Book of Mormon?An ancient text? Errors which are unique to the 1769 edition that Joseph Smith owned?</p></li><li><p>When King James translators were translating the KJV Bible between 1604 and 1611, they would occasionally put in their own words into the text to make the English more readable. We know exactly what these words are because they’re italicized in the KJV Bible. What are these 17<sup>th</sup> century italicized words doing in the Book of Mormon? Word for word? What does this say about the Book of Mormon being an ancient record?</p><p>Examples:</p><p><img src=./img/BoM_Isaiah_Comparison.png alt="BoM Isaiah Comparison"></p><p>The above example, 2 Nephi 19:1, dated in the Book of Mormon to be around 550 BC, quotes nearly verbatim from the 1611 AD translation of Isaiah 9:1 KJV—including the translators’ italicized words. Additionally, Joseph qualified the sea as the Red Sea. The problem with this is that (a) Christ quoted Isaiah in Matt. 4:14-15 and did not mention the Red Sea, (b) “Red” sea is not found in any source manuscripts, and © the Red Sea is 250 miles away.</p><p><img src=./img/BoM_Malachi_Comparison.png alt="BoM Malachi Comparison"></p><p>In the above example, the KJV translators added 7 italicized words not found in the source Hebrew manuscripts to its English translation. Why does the Book of Mormon, completed 1,200 years prior, contain the exact identical seven italicized words of 17<sup>th</sup> century translators?</p></li><li><p>The Book of Mormon includes mistranslated biblical passages that were later changed in Joseph Smith’s translation of the Bible. These Book of Mormon verses should match the inspired JST version instead of the KJV version that Joseph later fixed. A typical example of the differences between the KJV, the BOM, and the JST:</p><ul><li><a href=./local/www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/13.25-27.html#24 title="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/3-ne/13.25-27?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>3 Nephi 13:25-27</a>:</li></ul><blockquote><p>25: …Therefore I say unto you, take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?<br>26: Behold the fowls of the air, for they sow not, neither do they reap nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?<br>27: Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</p></blockquote><ul><li><a href=./local/www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/6.25-27.html#24 title="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/nt/matt/6.25-27?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Matthew 6:25-27 (from the King James Version Bible—not the JST)</a>:</li></ul><blockquote><p>25: Therefore I say unto you, Take no thought for your life, what ye shall eat, or what ye shall drink; nor yet for your body, what ye shall put on. Is not the life more than meat, and the body than raiment?<br>26: Behold the fowls of the air: for they sow not, neither do they reap, nor gather into barns; yet your heavenly Father feedeth them. Are ye not much better than they?<br>27: Which of you by taking thought can add one cubit unto his stature?</p></blockquote><p>The above Sermon on the Mount passages are identical, which is understandable as Christ may have said the same thing to both groups of people in the Old world as well as the New world. Let’s look at the JST version of the above identical passages:</p><ul><li><a href=./local/www.lds.org/scriptures/jst/jst-matt/6.html#1 title="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/jst/jst-matt/6?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Joseph Smith Translation of the same passages in the LDS Bible for Matthew 6:25-27</a>:</li></ul><blockquote><p>25: And, again, I say unto you, Go ye into the world, and care not for the world: for the world will hate you, and will persecute you, and will turn you out of their synagogues.<br>26: Nevertheless, ye shall go forth from house to house, teaching the people; and I will go before you.<br>27: And your heavenly Father will provide for you, whatsoever things ye need for food, what ye shall eat; and for raiment, what ye shall wear or put on.</p></blockquote><p>Christ’s Sermon on the Mount in the Bible and the Book of Mormon are identical. Joseph Smith corrected the Bible. In doing so, he also corrected the same identical passage in the Book of Mormon. The Book of Mormon is “the most correct book” and was translated a mere decade before the JST. The Book of Mormon was not corrupted over time and did not need correcting. How is it that the Book of Mormon still has the incorrect passage and does not match the correct JST in the first place?</p></li><li><p><a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics_and_the_Book_of_Mormon.html title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Genetics_and_the_Book_of_Mormon target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>DNA analysis</a> has concluded that Native American Indians do not originate from the Middle East or from Israelites but rather from Asia.

This is one of the reasons why unofficial apologists are coming up with the <a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_geography_model.html title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Limited_geography_model target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Limited Geography Model</a> (it happened in Central or South America) and that the real Hill Cumorah is not in Palmyra, New York but is elsewhere and possibly somewhere down there instead. This is in direct contradiction to what Joseph Smith and other prophets have taught. Never mind that the Church has a visitor’s center there in New York and holds annual Hill Cumorah pageants.</p><p>We read about two major war battles that took place at the Hill Cumorah (Ramah to the Jaredites) that numbered in the deaths of at least 2,000,000 people. No bones, hair, chariots, swords, armor, or any other evidence found whatsoever.</p><p>Compare this to the Roman occupation of Britain and other countries. There are abundant evidences of their presence during the first 400 years AD such as villas, mosaic floors, public baths, armor, weapons, writings, art, pottery and so on. Even the major road systems used today in some of these occupied countries were built by the Romans. Additionally, there is ample evidence of the Mayan and Aztec civilizations as well as a civilization in current day Texas that dates back 15,000 years. Where are the Nephite or Lamanite buildings, roads, armors, swords, pottery, art, etc.?</p><p>Latter-day Saint Thomas Stuart Ferguson was BYU’s archaeology division (New World Archaeological Funding) founder. NWAF was financed by the Church. NWAF and Ferguson were tasked by BYU and the Church in the 1950s and 1960s to <a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_authenticity_of_the_Book_of_Mormon.html#LDS-funded_archaeology title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Historical_authenticity_of_the_Book_of_Mormon#LDS-funded_archaeology target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>find archaeological evidence</a> to support the Book of Mormon. This is what Ferguson wrote after 17 years of trying to dig up evidence for the Book of Mormon:</p><blockquote><p>“…you can’t set Book of Mormon geography down anywhere—because it is fictional and will never meet the requirements of the dirt-archaeology.

He is considered to be a contemporary source. This is what he said about Joseph Smith:</p><blockquote><p>“Joseph…had learned to read comprehensively…[reading] works of fiction and records of criminality, such for instance as would be classed with the ‘dime novels’ of the present day. The stories of Stephen Buroughs and Captain Kidd, and the like, presented the highest charms for his expanding mental perceptions.”<br>— <a href=./local/archive.org/stream/originriseprogre00tuck/originriseprogre00tuck_djvu.txt.html#maincontent title=https://ia600404.us.archive.org/15/items/originriseprogre00tuck/originriseprogre00tuck.pdf target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Mormonism: Its Origin, Rise, and Progress, p.17</a></p></blockquote><p>Some apologists say that Tucker’s <a href=./local/archive.org/stream/originriseprogre00tuck/originriseprogre00tuck_djvu.txt.html#maincontent title=https://ia600404.us.archive.org/15/items/originriseprogre00tuck/originriseprogre00tuck.pdf target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Mormonism: Its Origin, Rise, and Progress</a> is anti-Mormonand thus anything in the book cannot be trusted. The problem with this premise is that LDS scholar and Church history compiler B.H.

Is Tucker’s peripheral information only useful and accurate when it shows Joseph and the Church in a positive and favorable light?</p><blockquote><p>“We are sorry to observe, even in this enlightened age, so prevalent a disposition to credit the accounts of the marvellous.

This article provides a snapshot of the worldview of 1825 New England.</p><p>Hill Cumorah and Moroni have absolutely nothing to do with Camora and Moroni from Captain Kidd stories?

Its Newtonian astronomy concepts, mechanics, and models of the universe have been discredited by 20<sup>th</sup> century Einsteinian physics.</p><p>What we find in Abraham 3 and the official scriptures of the LDS Church regarding science reflects a Newtonian world concept. The Catholic Church’s Ptolemaic cosmology was displaced by the new Copernican and Newtonian world model, just as the nineteenth-century, canonized, Newtonian world view is challenged by Einstein’s twentieth-century science.</p><p>Keith Norman, an LDS scholar, has written that for the LDS Church, “It is no longer possible to pretend there is no conflict.”</p><p>Norman continues: “Scientific cosmology began its leap forward just when Mormon doctrine was becoming stabilized. The revolution in twentieth-century physics precipitated by Einstein dethroned Newtonian physics as the ultimate explanation of the way the universe works. Relativity theory and quantum mechanics, combined with advances in astronomy, have established a vastly different picture of how the universe began, how it is structured and operates, and the nature of matter and energy. This new scientific cosmology poses a serious challenge to the Mormon version of the universe.”</p><p>Many of the astronomical and cosmological ideas found in both Joseph Smith’s environment and in the Book of Abraham have become out of vogue, and some of these Newtonian concepts are scientific relics.

Dick’s lengthy book, an ambitious treatise on astronomy and metaphysics, proposed the idea that matter is eternal and indestructible and rejected the notion of a creation ex nihilo. Much of the book dealt with the infinity of the universe, made up of innumerable stars spread out over immeasurable distances. Dick speculated that many of these stars were peopled by “various orders of intelligences” and that these intelligences were “progressive beings” in various stages of evolution toward perfection. In the Book of Abraham, part of which consists of a treatise on astronomy and cosmology, eternal beings of various orders and stages of development likewise populate numerous stars. They, too, are called “intelligences.” Dick speculated that “the systems of the universe revolve around a common centre…the throne of God.” In the Book of Abraham, one star named Kolob “was nearest unto the throne of God.” Other stars, in ever diminishing order, were placed in increasing distances from this center.”<br><small>— (Mormonism and the American Experience, Klaus Hansen, p.79-80, 110)</small></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Elder Jeffrey R.

This is not the Joseph Smith I grew up learning about in the Church and having a testimony of. This is not the Joseph Smith that I sang “Praise to the Man” to or taught others about two years in the mission field.</p><p>A lot of members don’t realize that there is a set of very specific and bizarre rules outlined in <a href=./local/www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.html title="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Doctrine &amp; Covenants 132</a> (still in LDS canon despite President Hinckley publicly stating that polygamy is not doctrinal) on how polygamy is to be practiced. It’s the kind of revelation you’d expect from the likes of Warren Jeffs to his FLDS followers.</p><p>The only form of polygamy permitted by D&amp;C 132 is a union with a virgin after first giving the opportunity to the first wife to consent to the marriage. If the first wife doesn’t consent, the husband is exempt and may still take an additional wife, but the first wife must at least have the opportunity to consent. In case the first wife doesn’t consent, she will be “destroyed”. Also, the new wife must be a virgin before the marriage and be completely monogamous after the marriage or she will be destroyed (D&amp;C 132:<a href=./local/www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.41.html#40 title="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.41?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>41</a> &amp; <a href=./local/www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.63.html#62 title="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.63?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>63</a>). It is interesting that the only prerequisite that is mentioned for the man is that he must desire another wife: “<a href=./local/www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.61.html#60 title="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.61?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>if any man espouse a virgin, and desire to espouse another…</a>”. It does not say that the man must get a specific revelation from the living prophet, although we assume today that this is what was meant.</p><p>D&amp;C 132 is unequivocal on the point that polygamy is permitted only “to multiply and replenish the earth” and “bear the souls of men.” This would be consistent with the Book of Mormon prohibition on polygamy except in the case where God commands it to “<a href=./local/www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.30.html#29 title="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/jacob/2.30?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>raise up seed</a>.”</p><p>Again, looking at how polygamy was actually practiced by Joseph Smith:</p><ul><li>Joseph married 11 women who were already married.

LDS historian, Richard Bushman, states: “There is evidence that Joseph was a polygamist by 1835” <small>— <em>Rough Stone Rolling,</em> p.323</small>. Plural marriages are rooted in the notion of “sealing” for both time and eternity. The “sealing” power was not restored until <a href=./local/elijah_appeared_to_joseph_in_kirtland_temple.html title="https://www.lds.org/ldsorg/v/index.jsp?hideNav=1&amp;locale=0&amp;sourceId=ddbff48fa2d20110VgnVCM100000176f620a____&amp;vgnextoid=198bf4b13819d110VgnVCM1000003a94610aRCRD" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>April 3, 1836 when Elijah appeared to Joseph in the Kirtland Temple</a> and conferred the sealing keys upon him.

These women were obviously not virgins, which violated <a href=./local/www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.61.html#60 title="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.61?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>D&amp;C 132:61</a>. Zina Huntington had been married seven and a half months and was about six months pregnant with her first husband’s baby at the time she married Joseph; clearly she didn’t need any more help to “bear the souls of men.”</p><p>Also, <a href=./local/www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.63.html#62 title="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/132.63?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>verse 63</a> states that if the new wives are with another man after the polygamous marriage, they will be destroyed. Eleven of Joseph’s wives lived with their prior husbands after marrying Joseph Smith. Most of them lived on to old age. Why weren’t they “destroyed”?</p><p>How about the consent of the first wife, which receives so much attention in D&amp;C 132? Emma was unaware of most of Joseph’s plural marriages, at least until after the fact, which violated D&amp;C 132.</p><p>I’ve been asked once by an LDS apologist if I would be okay with Joseph Smith’s polygamy and polyandry if I received a witness that God really did command Joseph Smith to participate in these practices. The question is not if I would “be okay with” God commanding Joseph Smith to secretly steal other men’s wives and to marry underage and teenage girls. The question is “Do I believe that God did such a thing?” The answer, based on comparing D&amp;C 132 to what actually happened, along with my personal belief that there is no such thing as an insane polygamist god who demanded such sadistic, immoral, adulterous, despicable, and pedophilic behavior while threatening Joseph’s life with one of his angels with a sword…is an emphatic and absolute “no.”</p><p>The secrecy of the marriages and the private and public denials by Joseph Smith are not congruent with honest behavior. Emma was unaware of most of these marriages. The Saints did not know what was going on behind the scenes as polygamy did not become common knowledge until 1852 when Brigham Young revealed it in Utah. Joseph Smith did everything he could to keep the practice in the dark. In fact, Joseph’s desire to keep this part of his life a secret is what ultimately contributed to his death when he ordered the destruction of the printing press (<a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauvoo_Expositor.html title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Nauvoo_Expositor target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Nauvoo Expositor</a>) that dared expose his behavior in June 1844. This event initiated a chain of events that led to Carthage.</p><p>Consider the following denial made by Joseph Smith to Latter-day Saints in Nauvoo in May 1844—a month before his death:</p><blockquote><p>“…What a thing it is for a man to be accused of committing adultery, and having seven wives, when I can only find one. I am the same man, and as innocent as I was fourteen years ago; and I can prove them all perjurers.” — <a href=./local/byustudies.byu.edu/content/volume-6-chapter-19.html#411 title=https://byustudies.byu.edu/hc/hcpgs/hc.aspx target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>History of the Church, Vol. 6, Chapter 19, p. 411</a></p></blockquote><p>It is a matter of historical fact that Joseph had secretly taken over 30 plural wives by May 1844 when he made the above denial that he was ever a polygamist.</p><p>If you go to <a href=./local/familysearch.org/ark:/61903/2:1:M18D-5C8.html title=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/2:1:M18D-5C8 target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Familysearch.org</a>—an LDS-owned genealogy website—you can clearly see that Joseph Smith had many wives. The Church’s new October 2014 <em><a href=./local/www.lds.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo.html title="https://www.lds.org/topics/plural-marriage-in-kirtland-and-nauvoo?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Plural Marriage in Kirtland and Nauvoo</a></em> essay acknowledges that Joseph Smith was a polygamist. The facts speak for themselves – from 100% LDS sources – that Joseph Smith was dishonest.</p><p>The following 1835 edition of Doctrine &amp; Covenants revelations bans polygamy:</p><blockquote><p><a href=./local/www.josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/doctrine-and-covenants-1835_259.html title="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/doctrine-and-covenants-1835?dm=image-and-text&amp;zm=zoom-inner&amp;tm=expanded&amp;p=259" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>1835 Doctrine &amp; Covenants 101:4</a>:<br>“Inasmuch as this Church of Christ has been reproached with the crime of fornication, and polygamy: we declare that we believe, that one man should have one wife; and one woman, but one husband, except in case of death, when either is at liberty to marry again.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><a href=./local/www.josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/doctrine-and-covenants-1835_129.html title="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/doctrine-and-covenants-1835?dm=image-and-text&amp;zm=zoom-inner&amp;tm=expanded&amp;p=129" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>1835 Doctrine &amp; Covenants 13:7</a>:<br>“Thou shalt love thy wife with all thy heart, and shall cleave unto her and none else.”</p></blockquote><blockquote><p><a href=./local/www.josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/doctrine-and-covenants-1835_200.html title="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/doctrine-and-covenants-1835?dm=image-and-text&amp;zm=zoom-inner&amp;tm=expanded&amp;p=200" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>1835 Doctrine &amp; Covenants 65:3</a>:<br>“Wherefore, it is lawful that he should have one wife, and they twain shall be one flesh, and all this that the earth might answer the end of its creation.”</p></blockquote><p>Joseph Smith was already a polygamist when these revelations were introduced into the <a href=./local/www.josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/doctrine-and-covenants-1835_9.html title="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/doctrine-and-covenants-1835?p=9" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>1835 edition of the Doctrine &amp; Covenants</a> and Joseph publicly taught that the doctrine of the Church was monogamy. Joseph continued secretly marrying multiple women as these revelations/scriptures remained in force.</p><p>In an attempt to influence and abate public rumors of his secret polygamy, Joseph got 31 witnesses to sign an affidavit published in the LDS <a href=./local/5058.pdf title=http://contentdm.lib.byu.edu/cdm/ref/collection/NCMP1820-1846/id/9966 target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>October 1, 1842 <em>Times and Seasons</em></a> stating that Joseph did <em>not</em> practice polygamy. Pointing to the above-mentioned D&amp;C 101:4 scripture, these witnesses claimed the following:</p><blockquote><p>“…we know of no other rule or system of marriage than the one published in the Book of Doctrine and Covenants.”</p></blockquote><p>The problem with this affidavit is that it was signed by several people who were secret polygamists or who knew that Joseph was a polygamist at the time they signed the affidavit. In fact, <a href=./local/familysearch.org/ark:/61903/2:1:M18Z-MRT.html title=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/2:1:M18Z-MRT target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Eliza R. Snow</a>, one of the signers of this affidavit, was Joseph Smith’s plural wife. Joseph and Eliza were married 3 months earlier on June 29, 1842. Two Apostles and future prophets, John Taylor and Wilford Woodruff, were very aware of Joseph’s polygamy behind the scenes when they signed. Another signer, Bishop Whitney, had personally married his daughter <a href=./local/familysearch.org/ark:/61903/2:1:M18Z-MTZ.html title=https://familysearch.org/ark:/61903/2:1:M18Z-MTZ target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Sarah Ann Whitney</a> to Joseph as a plural wife a few months earlier on July 27, 1842; Whitney’s wife and Sarah’s mother Elizabeth (also a signer) witnessed the ceremony.</p><p>What does it say about Joseph Smith and his character to include his plural wife and buddies—who knew about his secret polygamy/polyandry—to lie and perjure in a sworn public affidavit that Joseph was not a polygamist?</p><p>Now, does the fact that Joseph Smith practiced polygamy and polyandry while lying to Emma, the Saints, and the public about it over the course of 10+ years prove that he was a false prophet? That the Church is false? No, it doesn’t.</p><p>What it <em>does</em> prove, however, is that Joseph Smith’s pattern of behavior or modus operandi for a period of at least 10 years of his adult life was to keep secrets, be deceptive, and be dishonest—both privately and publicly.</p><p>It’s when you take this snapshot of Joseph’s character and start looking into the Book of Abraham, the Kinderhook Plates, the Book of Mormon, the multiple First Vision accounts, Priesthood restoration, and so on that you start to see a very disturbing pattern and picture.</p><p class="caption boxed"><img src=./img/Joseph_Smith_vs_Warren_Jeffs_Infographic.png alt="Warren Jeffs is more closely aligned to Joseph Smith Mormonism than the LDS Church is"> Warren Jeffs is more closely aligned to Joseph Smith Mormonism than the LDS Church is. <a href=./local/www.mormoninfographics.com/2012/08/joseph-smith-vs-warren-jeffs-visualized.html title=http://www.mormoninfographics.com/2012/08/joseph-smith-vs-warren-jeffs-visualized.html target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Source</a></p><p></p><div style="text-align: center"><a href=./local/www.mormoninfographics.com/2012/09/the-many-wives-of-joseph-smith.html title=http://www.mormoninfographics.com/2012/09/the-many-wives-of-joseph-smith.html target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink><img src=./img/The_Many_Wives_of_Joseph_Smith_Infographic.png alt="The Many Wives of Joseph Smith Infographic"></a></div><p></p><h1><em>Prophets</em> Concerns &amp; Questions:</h1><ol><li><p><strong>Adam-God:</strong> President Brigham Young taught what is now known as “Adam-God theory.” He taught that Adam is “our Father and our God, and the only God with whom we have to do.” Young not only taught this doctrine over the pulpit at the <a href=./local/journalofdiscourses.com/1/8.html title=https://journalofdiscourses.com/1/8 target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>1852</a> and <a href=./local/signaturebookslibrary.org/essential-brigham-young-09/index.html title=http://signaturebookslibrary.org/essential-brigham-young-09/ target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>1854</a> General Conferences but he also introduced this doctrine as the <a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Adam%E2%80%93God_doctrine.html#Adam.E2.80.93God_in_Young.27s_later_administration title=http://bit.ly/Zm32vC target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Lecture at the Veil</a> in the endowment ceremony of the Temple.</p><p>Prophets and apostles after Young renounced Adam-God theory as false doctrine. President Spencer W.

Kimball and similar statements from others, Bruce R. McConkie made the following statement:</p><blockquote><p>“The devil keeps this heresy alive as a means of obtaining converts to cultism. It is contrary to the whole plan of salvation set forth in the scriptures, and anyone who has read the Book of Moses, and anyone who has received the temple endowment, has no excuse whatever for being led astray by it.

I will say further;</p><p>I have had men come to me and offer their lives to atone for their sins.</p><p>It is true that the blood of the Son of God was shed for sins through the fall and those committed by men, yet men can commit sins which it can never remit… There are sins that can be atoned for by an offering upon an altar, as in ancient days; and there are sins that the blood of a lamb, or a calf, or of turtle dove, cannot remit, but they must be atoned for by the blood of the man.&quot;<br>— <a href=./local/journalofdiscourses.com/4/10.html title=https://journalofdiscourses.com/4/10 target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Journal of Discourses, Vol. 4, p. 53-54</a></p></blockquote><p>The doctrine was later declared false by future prophets and apostles.

Every single prophet from Brigham Young all the way to Harold B. Lee kept this ban in place.</p><p>Prophets, Seers, and Revelators of 2013 – in its December 2013 <a href=./local/www.lds.org/topics/race-and-the-priesthood.html title="https://www.lds.org/topics/race-and-the-priesthood?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Race and the Priesthood</a> essay – disavowed the “theories” of yesterday’s Prophets, Seers, and Revelators for their theological, institutional, and doctrinal racist teachings and “revelation”. Yesterday’s racist doctrine and revelation is today’s “disavowed theories”.</p><p>Joseph Smith permitted the priesthood to at least two black men. <a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Abel.html title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Elijah_Abel target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Elijah Abel</a> was one of them. <a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_lewis.html title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Walker_lewis target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Walker Lewis</a> was another.</p><p>So, Joseph Smith gives the priesthood to blacks. Brigham Young bans blacks. Each and every single one of the 10 prophets from Brigham Young to Harold B. Lee supported what Spencer W. Kimball referred to as a “possible error” (Teachings of Spencer W. Kimball, p. 448-449).</p><p>Heavenly Father likes blacks enough to give them the priesthood under Joseph Smith but He decides they’re not okay when Brigham Young shows up. And He still doesn’t think they’re okay for the next 130 years and the next 9 prophets until President Kimball decides to get a revelation.</p><p>The same God who “<a href=./local/www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33.html#32 title="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/bofm/2-ne/26.33?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>denieth none that come unto him, black and white, bond and free, male and female</a>” is the same God who denied blacks from the saving ordinances of the Temple for 130 years. Yet, He changed His mind again in 1978 about black people. Of course, the revelation He gives to the Brethren in the Salt Lake Temple on June 1, 1978 has absolutely nothing to do with Jimmy Carter’s IRS potentially revoking the Church’s tax-exempt status, Stanford and other universities boycotting BYU athletics, we can’t figure out who’s black or not in Brazil, and that post-Civil Rights societal trends were against the Church’s racism. Christ’s true Church should have been the one leading the Civil Rights movement, not be the last major Church on the planet in 1978 to adopt it.</p><p>As a believing member, I had no idea that Joseph Smith gave the priesthood to black men. I’m supposed to go to the drawing board now and believe in a god who is not only a schizophrenic racist but who is inconsistent as well?</p><p>Yesterday’s doctrine is today’s false doctrine.

We have a vivid illustration of this in the recent media excitement about the word salamander in a letter Martin Harris is supposed to have sent to W. W. Phelps over 150 years ago. All of the scores of media stories on that subject apparently assume that the author of that letter used the word salamander in the modern sense of a “tailed amphibian.”</p><p>One wonders why so many writers neglected to reveal to their readers that there is another meaning of salamander, which may even have been the primary meaning in this context in the 1820s. That meaning, which is listed second in a current edition of Webster’s New World Dictionary, is “a spirit supposed to live in fire” (2d College ed. 1982, s.v. “salamander”). Modern and ancient literature contain many examples of this usage.</p><p>A spirit that is able to live in fire is a good approximation of the description Joseph Smith gave of the angel Moroni: a personage in the midst of a light, whose countenance was “truly like lightning” and whose overall appearance “was glorious beyond description” (Joseph Smith-History 1:32). As Joseph Smith wrote later, “The first sight [of this personage] was as though the house was filled with consuming fire” (History of the Church, 4:536). Since the letter purports only to be Martin Harris’s interpretation of what he had heard about Joseph’s experience, the use of the words white salamander and old spirit seem understandable.</p><p>In view of all this, and as a matter of intellectual evaluation, why all the excitement in the media, and why the apparent hand-wringing among those who profess friendship with or membership in the Church? The media should make more complete disclosures, but Latter-day Saint readers should also be more sophisticated in their evaluation of what they read.</p></blockquote><p>So, what just happened? Oaks defended and rationalized a completely fake and made up document that Mark Hofmann created while telling “Latter-day Saint readers” to be “more sophisticated in their evaluation of what they read.”</p></li><li><p>Dishonesty by Hinckley on his relationship with Hofmann, his meetings, and which documents that the Church had and didn’t have.</p></li><li><p>The Church was forced to produce, albeit reluctantly, documents that it had previously denied existed after Hofmann leaked to the media that he sold the documents to the Church.</p></li><li><p>While these “prophets, seers, and revelators” were being duped and conned by Mark Hofmann’s forgeries, the Tanners—considered some of the biggest enemies of the Church—actually came out and said that the Salamander Letter was a <a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hofmann.html#Salamander_letter title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mark_Hofmann#Salamander_letter target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>fake</a>. Even when the Salamander Letter proved very useful to discrediting the Church, the Tanners had better discernment than the Brethren did. While the Tanners publicly rejected the Salamander Letter, the Church continued buying fakes from Hofmann and Elder Oaks continued telling Latter-day Saints to be more sophisticated.</p></li></ul></li></ol><p>I’m told that prophets are just men who are only prophets when acting as such (whatever that means). I’m told that like all prophets, Brigham Young was a man of his time. For example, I was told that Brigham Young was acting as a man when he taught that Adam is our God and the only God with whom we have to deal with. Never mind that he taught it over the pulpit in not one but two General Conferences and never mind that he introduced this theology into the endowment ceremony in the Temples.</p><p>Never mind that Brigham Young made it clear that he was speaking as a prophet:</p><blockquote><p>“I have never yet preached a sermon and sent it out to the children of men, that they may not call scripture.” — <a href=./local/journalofdiscourses.com/13/13.html title=https://journalofdiscourses.com/13/13 target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Journal of Discourses, Vol.13, page 95</a></p></blockquote><p>Why would I want my kids singing “Follow the Prophet” with such a ridiculous 183 year track record? What credibility do the Brethren have? Why would I want them following the prophet when a prophet is just a man of his time? If his moral blueprint is not much better than their Sunday School teachers? If, historically speaking, the doctrine he teaches today will likely be tomorrow’s false doctrine?</p><p>If Brigham Young was really a prophet, seer, and revelator, would it not be unreasonable to expect that God would give him a hint that racism is not okay, sexism is not okay, blood atonement is not okay, and God’s name is not “Adam”?</p><h1><em>Kinderhook Plates and Translator/Seer</em> Claims Concerns &amp; Questions:</h1><ol><li><p><strong>Kinderhook Plates:</strong></p><blockquote><p>“Church historians continued to insist on the authenticity of the Kinderhook plates until 1980 when an examination conducted by the Chicago Historical Society, possessor of one plate, proved it was a nineteenth-century creation.” — LDS Historian Richard Bushman, <em>Rough Stone Rolling,</em> p. 490</p></blockquote><p></p><div style="text-align: center"><a href=./local/www.mormoninfographics.com/2012/09/kinderhook-plates-hoax-or-history.html title=http://www.mormoninfographics.com/2012/09/kinderhook-plates-hoax-or-history.html target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink><img src=./img/Kinderhook_Plates_Infographic.png alt="Kinderhook Plates Infographic"></a></div><p></p></li><li><p><strong>Book of Abraham:</strong></p><ul><li><p>As outlined in the “Book of Abraham” section, Joseph Smith got everything wrong about the papyri, the facsimiles, the names, the gods, the scene context, the fact that the papyri and facsimiles were 1<sup>st</sup> century CE funerary text, who was male, who was female, etc. It’s gibberish.</p><p>There is not one single non-LDS Egyptologist who supports Joseph’s Book of Abraham or its claims.

I saw that we had evidence and logic on our side based on the correlated narrative I was fed by the Church about its origins. I lost this confidence at 31-years-old when I discovered that the gap between what the Church teaches about its origins versus what the primary historical documents actually show happened, what history shows what happened, what science shows what happened…couldn’t be further apart.</p><p>I read an experience that explains this in another way:</p><blockquote><p>“I resigned from the LDS Church and informed my bishop that the reasons had to do with discovering the real history of the Church. When I was done he asked about the spiritual witness I had surely received as a missionary. I agreed that I had felt a sure witness, as strong as he currently felt. I gave him the analogy of Santa; I believed in Santa until I was 12. I refused to listen to reason from my friends who had discovered the truth much earlier…I just knew. However, once I learned the facts, feelings changed. I told him that Mormons have to re-define faith in order to believe; traditionally, faith is an instrument to bridge that gap between where science, history and logic end, and what you hope to be true. Mormonism re-defines faith as embracing what you hope to be true in spite of science, fact and history.”</p></blockquote></li><li><p><strong><a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_H._Dunn.html title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Paul_H._Dunn target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Paul H.

Oaks on how to gain a testimony:</p><blockquote><p>“It is not unusual to have a missionary say, ‘How can I bear testimony until I get one? How can I testify that God lives, that Jesus is the Christ, and that the gospel is true? If I do not have such a testimony, would that not be dishonest?’ Oh, if I could teach you this one principle: a testimony is to be found in the bearing of it!”<br>— Boyd K. Packer, <em><a href=./local/www.lds.org/new-era/2007/01/the-quest-for-spiritual-knowledge.html title="https://www.lds.org/new-era/2007/01/the-quest-for-spiritual-knowledge?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>The Quest for Spiritual Knowledge</a></em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“Another way to seek a testimony seems astonishing when compared with the methods of obtaining other knowledge. We gain or strengthen a testimony by bearing it. Someone even suggested that some testimonies are better gained on the feet bearing them than on the knees praying for them.”<br>— Dallin H. Oaks, <em><a href=./local/www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/04/testimony.html title="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2008/04/testimony?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Testimony</a></em></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“It may come as you bear your own testimony of the Prophet…Consider recording the testimony of Joseph Smith in your own voice, listening to it regularly…Listening to the Prophet’s testimony in your own voice will help bring the witness you seek.”<br>– Neil L. Andersen, <em><a href=./local/www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/joseph-smith.html title="https://www.lds.org/general-conference/2014/10/joseph-smith?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Joseph Smith</a></em></p></blockquote><p>In other words, repeat things over and over until you convince yourself that it’s true. Just keep telling yourself, “I know it’s true…I know it’s true…I know it’s true” until you believe it and voilà! You now have a testimony that the Church is true and Joseph Smith was a prophet.</p><p>How is this honest? How is this ethical? What kind of advice are these Apostles giving when they’re telling you that if you don’t have a testimony, bear one anyway? How is this not lying? There’s a difference between saying you know something and you believe something.</p><p>What about members and investigators who are on the other side listening to your “testimony”? How are they supposed to know whether you actually do have a testimony of Mormonism or if you’re just following Packer’s and Oaks’ advice and you’re lying your way into one?</p></li><li><p>There are many members who share their testimonies that the Spirit told them that they were to marry this person or go to this school or move to this location or start up this business or invest in this investment. They rely on this Spirit in making critical life decisions. When the decision turns out to be not only incorrect but disastrous, the fault lies on the individual and never on the Spirit. The individual didn’t have the discernment or it was the individual’s hormones talking or it was the individual’s greed that was talking or the individual wasn’t worthy at the time. This poses a profound flaw and dilemma: if individuals can be so convinced that they’re being led by the Spirit but yet be so wrong about what the Spirit tells them, how can they be sure of the reliability of this same exact process in telling them that Mormonism is true?</p></li><li><p>I felt the Spirit watching “Saving Private Ryan” and the “Schindler’s List.” Both R-rated and horribly violent movies. I also felt the Spirit watching “Forrest Gump” and the “Lion King.” After I lost my testimony, I attended a conference where former Mormons shared their stories. The same Spirit I felt telling me that Mormonism is true and that Joseph Smith was a true prophet is the same Spirit I felt in all of the above experiences.</p><p>Does this mean that Lion King is true? That Mufasa is real and true? Does this mean that Forrest Gump is real and the story happened in real life? Why did I feel the Spirit as I listened to the stories of apostates sharing how they discovered for themselves that Mormonism is not true? Why is this Spirit so unreliable and inconsistent? How can I trust such an inconsistent and contradictory Source for knowing that Mormonism is worth betting my life, time, money, heart, mind, and obedience to?</p></li></ol><p>This thought–provoking video raises some profound questions and challenges to the Latter-day Saint concept of “testimony” and receiving a witness from the Holy Ghost or Spirit as being a unique, reliable, and trustworthy source to discerning truth and reality:</p><div class=centered><div class=playButton data-type=svg><svg xmlns=http://www.w3.org/2000/svg xmlns:xlink=http://www.w3.org/1999/xlink version=1.1 x=0px y=0px viewBox="0 0 510 510" xml:space=preserve><g><g class=play-circle-outline><path d="M204,369.75L357,255L204,140.25V369.75z M255,0C114.75,0,0,114.75,0,255s114.75,255,255,255s255-114.75,255-255 S395.25,0,255,0z M255,459c-112.2,0-204-91.8-204-204S142.8,51,255,51s204,91.8,204,204S367.2,459,255,459z"></path></g></g></svg></div><p><a href=./local/ycUvC9s4VYA.mp4 title="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=ycUvC9s4VYA" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink><img src=./img/Follow_The_Spirit_Thumbnail.jpg alt="Follow the Spirit Thumbnail" class=boxed></a></p></div><h1><em>Priesthood Restoration</em> Concerns &amp; Questions:</h1><div class=centered><blockquote><p>“The late appearance of these accounts raises the possibility of later fabrication.”<br>— <a href=./local/books.google.com/Mz3tpz4eRBQC_PA75.html title=http://bit.ly/15elTzT target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>LDS Historian Richard Bushman, <em>Rough Stone Rolling,</em> p. 75</a> —</p></blockquote></div><ol><li><p>Like the First Vision story, none of the members of the Church or Joseph Smith’s family had ever heard prior to 1834 about a priesthood restoration from John the Baptist or Peter, James, and John.

It’s not recorded anywhere in the Book of Commandments.</p></li><li><p>It wasn’t until the 1835 edition Doctrine &amp; Covenants that Joseph and Oliver backdated and retrofitted Priesthood restoration events to an 1829-30 time period—none of which existed in any previous Church records; including Doctrine &amp; Covenants’ precursor, The Book of Commandments, nor the original Church history as published in <em>The Evening and Morning Star.</em></p></li><li><p>David Whitmer, one of the witnesses to the Book of Mormon, had this to say about the Priesthood restoration:</p><blockquote><p>“I never heard that an Angel had ordained Joseph and Oliver to the Aaronic Priesthood until the year 1834[,] [183]5, or [183]6—in Ohio…I do not believe that John the Baptist ever ordained Joseph and Oliver…”<br><small><em>— Early Mormon Documents, 5:137</em></small></p></blockquote></li></ol><h1><em>Witnesses</em> Concerns &amp; Questions:</h1><ol><li><p>The testimony of the Three and Eight witnesses to the Book of Mormon is a key part to the testimonies of many members of the Church. Some even base their testimony of the truthfulness of the Book of Mormon on these 11 witnesses and their testimonies. As a missionary, I was instructed to teach investigators about the testimonies of the witnesses to the Book of Mormon as part of boosting the book’s credibility.</p><p>There are several critical problems for relying and betting on these 19<sup>th</sup> century men as credible witnesses.</p></li><li><p><strong>Magical Worldview:</strong> In order to truly understand the Book of Mormon witnesses and the issues, one must understand the magical worldview of people in early 19<sup>th</sup> century New England. These are people who believed in folk magic, divining rods, visions, second sight, peep stones in hats, treasure hunting (money digging or glass looking), and so on.</p><p>Many people believed in buried treasure, the ability to see spirits and their dwelling places within the local hills and elsewhere. This is why treasure digging existed. Joseph Smith, his father, and his brother (Hyrum) had a family business treasure hunting from 1820–1827. Joseph was hired by folks like Josiah Stowell, who Joseph mentions in his <a href=./local/www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.56-58.html#55 title="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/pgp/js-h/1.56-58?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>history</a>. In 1826, Joseph was <a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith.html#Treasure_hunting title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Early_life_of_Joseph_Smith#Work_as_a_treasure_hunter_and_marriage_to_Emma_Hale target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>arrested</a> and brought to court in Bainbridge, New York, for trial on fraud. He was arrested on the complaint of Stowell’s nephew who accused Joseph of being a “disorderly person and an imposter.”</p><p>It would not be unusual for a neighbor, friend, or even a stranger to come up to you and say, “I received a vision of the Lord!” and for you to respond, “What did the Lord say?”</p><p>This is one of the reasons why 21<sup>st</sup> century Mormons, once including myself, are so confused and bewildered when hearing stuff like Joseph Smith using a peep stone in a hat or Oliver Cowdery using a <a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowsing.html title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dowsing target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>divining rod or dowsing rod</a> such as illustrated below:</p><p class=dowsingPictures><img src=./img/Oliver_Cowdrey_Dowsing.jpg alt="Oliver Cowdery Dowsing" class=boxed> <img src=./img/Using_a_Dowsing_Rod.jpg alt="Using a Dowsing Rod" class=boxed></p><p>The above divining rod is mentioned in the scriptures. In Doctrine &amp; Covenants 8, the following heading provides context for the discussion:</p><blockquote><p>“Revelation given through Joseph Smith the Prophet to Oliver Cowdery, at Harmony, Pennsylvania, April 1829. In the course of the translation of the Book of Mormon, Oliver, who continued to serve as scribe, writing at the Prophet’s dictation, desired to be endowed with the gift of translation. The Lord responded to his supplication by granting this revelation.”</p></blockquote><p>The revelation states, in relevant part:</p><blockquote><p>6 Now this is not all they gift; for you have another gift, which is the <strong>gift of Aaron;</strong> behold, it has told you many things;<br>7 Behold, there is no other power, save the power of God, that can cause this gift of Aaron to be with you.<br>8 Therefore, doubt not, for <strong>it is the gift of God; and you shall hold it in your hands,</strong> and <strong>do marvelous works;</strong> and no power shall be able to take it away out of your hands, for <strong>it is the work of God.</strong><br>9 And, therefore, <strong>whatsoever you shall ask me to tell you by that means, that I will grant unto you,</strong> and you shall have knowledge concerning it.<br>10 Remember that <strong>without faith you can do nothing; therefore ask in faith.</strong> Trifle not with these things; do not ask for that which you ought not.<br>11 <strong>Ask</strong> that you may know the mysteries of God, and <strong>that you may translate and receive knowledge from all those ancient records which have been hid up, that are sacred;</strong> and according to your faith shall it be done unto you.</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>(<a href=./local/www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.6-11.html#5 title="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.6-11?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>D&amp;C 8:6-11</a>, emphasis added)</p></blockquote><p>From the D&amp;C 8 account, we don’t really know much about what exactly the “gift of Aaron” is that Oliver Cowdery received. What is “the gift of Aaron”? The text provides several clues:</p><ul><li>Oliver has a history of using it, since “it has told [him] many things.”</li><li>It is “the gift of God.”</li><li>It is to be held in Oliver’s hands (and kept there, impervious to any power).</li><li>It allows Oliver to “do marvelous works.”</li><li>It is “the work of God.”</li><li>The Lord will speak through it to Oliver and tell him anything he asks while using it.</li><li>It works through faith.</li><li>It enables Oliver to translate ancient sacred documents.</li></ul><p>With only these clues, the “gift of Aaron” remains very hard to identify. The task becomes much easier, however, when we look at the original revelation contained in The Book of Commandments, a predecessor volume to the Doctrine &amp; Covenants, used by the LDS Church before 1835. <a href=./local/www.josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/book-of-commandments-1833_23.html title="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/book-of-commandments-1833?p=23" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Section 7 of the Book of Commandments</a> contains wording that was changed in the <a href=./local/www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8.html title="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/8?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Doctrine &amp; Covenants 8</a>. The term “gift of Aaron” was originally “rod” and “rod of nature” in the Book of Commandments:</p><blockquote><p>“Now this is not all, for you have another gift, which is the <strong>gift of working with the rod:</strong> behold it has told you things: behold there is no other power save God, that can cause this <strong>rod of nature,</strong> to work in your hands.”<br>— <a href=./local/www.josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/book-of-commandments-1833_23.html title="https://www.josephsmithpapers.org/paperSummary/book-of-commandments-1833?p=23" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>The Book of Commandments 7:3</a></p></blockquote><p>So, what is the “gift of Aaron” mentioned in D&amp;C 8? It is a “rod of nature.”</p><p>What is a “rod of nature”? It is a divining rod or dowsing rod as illustrated in the above images, which Oliver Cowdery used to hunt for buried treasure.</p><p>Cowdery’s use of a divining rod to search for buried treasure evokes similar images of Joseph Smith hunting for treasure with a stone in a hat. Oliver also wished to use his divining rod, in the same way Joseph Smith used his stone and hat, to translate ancient documents. Doctrine &amp; Covenants 8 indicates that the Lord, through Joseph Smith, granted Oliver’s request to translate using a…rod.</p><p>If Oliver Cowdery’s gift was really a divining rod then this tells us that the origins of the Church are much more involved in folk magic and superstition than we’ve been led to believe by the LDS Church’s whitewashing of its origins and history.</p></li><li><p><strong>Witnesses:</strong></p><p>We are told that the witnesses never disavowed their testimonies, but we have not come to know these men or investigated what else they said about their experiences.</p><p>They are 11 individuals: Martin Harris, Oliver Cowdery, Hiram Page, David Whitmer, John Whitmer, Christian Whitmer, Jacob Whitmer, Peter Whitmer Jr., Hyrum Smith, Samuel Smith, and Joseph Smith Sr.—who all shared a common worldview of second sight, magic, and treasure digging—which is what drew them together in 1829.</p><p>The following are several facts and observations on several of the Book of Mormon Witnesses:</p><ul><li><p><strong>Martin Harris:</strong></p><p>Martin Harris was anything but a skeptical witness. He was known by many of his peers as an unstable, gullible, and superstitious man. Reports assert that he and the other witnesses never literally saw the gold plates, but only an object said to be the plates, covered with a cloth. Additionally, Martin Harris had a direct conflict of interest in being a witness. He was deeply financially invested in the Book of Mormon as he mortgaged his farm to finance the book. The following are some accounts that show the superstitious side of Martin Harris:</p><blockquote><p>“Once while reading scripture, he reportedly mistook a candle’s sputtering as a sign that the devil desired him to stop. Another time he excitedly awoke from his sleep believing that a creature as large as a dog had been upon his chest, though a nearby associate could find nothing to confirm his fears. Several hostile and perhaps unreliable accounts told of visionary experiences with Satan and Christ, Harris once reporting that Christ had been poised on a roof beam.”<br><small>— BYU professor Ronald W. Walker, “Martin Harris: Mormonism’s Early Convert,” p.34-35</small></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“No matter where he went, he saw visions and supernatural appearances all around him. He told a gentleman in Palmyra, after one of his excursions to Pennsylvania, while the translation of the Book of Mormon was going on, that on the way he met the Lord Jesus Christ, who walked along by the side of him in the shape of a deer for two or three miles, talking with him as familiarly as one man talks with another.”<br><small>— John A. Clark letter, August 31, 1840 in Early Mormon Documents, 2: 271</small></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>“According to two Ohio newspapers, shortly after Harris arrived in Kirtland he began claiming to have `seen Jesus Christ and that he is the handsomest man he ever did see. He has also seen the Devil, whom he described as a very sleek haired fellow with four feet, and a head like that of a Jack-ass.’”<br><small>— Early Mormon Documents 2: 271, note 32.</small></p></blockquote><p>Before Harris became a Mormon, he had already <a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_Latter_Day_Saints.html#Strangite.2C_Whitmerite.2C_Gladdenite.2C_Williamite.2C_Shaker title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Martin_Harris_(Latter_Day_Saints)#Strangite.2C_Whitmerite.2C_Gladdenite.2C_Williamite.2C_Shaker target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>changed his religion</a> at least five times. After Joseph’s death, Harris continued this earlier pattern by joining and leaving 5 more different sects, including James Strang (whom Harris went on a mission to England for), other Mormon offshoots, and the Shakers. Not only did Harris join other religions, he testified and witnessed for them. It has been reported that Martin Harris “declared repeatedly that he had as much evidence for a Shaker book he had as for the Book of Mormon” (The Braden and Kel y Debate, p.173).</p><p>In addition to devotion to self-proclaimed prophet James Strang, Martin Harris was a follower to another self-proclaimed Mormon prophet by the name of <a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladden_Bishop.html title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladden_Bishop target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Gladden Bishop</a>. Like Strang, Bishop claimed to have plates, Urim and Thummim, and that he was receiving revelation from the Lord. Martin was one of <a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladden_Bishop.html#Final_apostasy_and_becoming_a_prophet title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gladden_Bishop#Final_apostasy_and_becoming_a_prophet target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Gladden Bishop’s witnesses</a> to his claims.</p><p>If someone testified of some strange spiritual encounter he had, but he also told you that he…</p><ul><li>conversed with Jesus who took the form of a deer</li><li>saw the devil with his four feet and donkey head</li><li>chipped off a chunk of a stone box that would mysteriously move beneath the ground to avoid capture</li><li>interpreted simple things like a flickering of a candle as a sign of the devil</li><li>had a creature appearing on his chest that no one else could see</li></ul><p>…would you believe his claims? Or would you call the nearest mental hospital?</p><p>With inconsistency, conflict of interest, magical thinking, and superstition like this, exactly what credibility does Martin Harris have and why should I believe him?</p></li><li><p><strong>David Whitmer:</strong></p><p>David claimed in early June 1829 before their group declaration that he, Cowdery, and Joseph Smith observed “one of the Nephites” carrying the records in a knapsack on his way to Cumorah. Several days later this trio perceived “that the Same Person was under the shed” at the Whitmer farm. <small>— <em>An Insider’s View of Mormon Origins,</em> p.179</small></p><p>In 1880, David Whitmer was asked for a description of the angel who showed him the plates. Whitmer responded that the angel “had no appearance or shape.” When asked by the interviewer how he then could bear testimony that he had seen and heard an angel, Whitmer replied, “Have you never had impressions?” To which the interviewer responded, “Then you had impressions as the Quaker when the spirit moves, or as a good Methodist in giving a happy experience, a feeling?” “Just so,” replied Whitmer. <small>— Interview with John Murphy, June 1880, EMD 5:63</small></p><p>A young Mormon lawyer, James Henry Moyle, who interviewed Whitmer in 1885, asked if there was any possibility that Whitmer had been deceived. “His answer was unequivocal….that he saw the plates and heard the angel with unmistakable clearness.” But Moyle went away “not fully satisfied….It was more spiritual than I anticipated.” <small>— Moyle diary, June 28, 1885, EMD 5:141</small></p><p>Whitmer’s testimony also included the following:</p><blockquote><p>“If you believe my testimony to the Book of Mormon; if you believe that God spake to us three witnesses by his own voice, then I tell you that in June, 1838, God spake to me again by his own voice from the heavens and told me to ‘separate myself from among the Latter Day Saints, for as they sought to do unto me, so it should be done unto them.’”<br><small>– David Whitmer, <em><a href=./local/books.google.com/wVU3AAAAMAAJ_PA27.html title="https://books.google.com/books?id=wVU3AAAAMAAJ&amp;pg=PA27&amp;hl=en#v=onepage&amp;q&amp;f=false" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>An Address to All Believers in Christ</a></em> (promoting his Whitmerite sect)</small></p></blockquote><p>If David Whitmer is a credible witness, why are we only using his testimony of the Book of Mormon while ignoring his <em>other</em> testimony claiming that God Himself spoke to Whitmer “by his own voice from the heavens” in June 1838 commanding Whitmer to apostatize from the Lord’s one and only true Church?</p></li><li><p><strong>Oliver Cowdery:</strong></p><p>Like Joseph and most of the Book of Mormon witnesses, Oliver Cowdery and his family were treasure hunters. Oliver’s preferred tool of trade, as mentioned above, was the divining rod. He was known as a “rodsman.” Along with the witnesses, Oliver held a magical mindset.</p><p>Oliver Cowdery was not an objective and independent witness. As scribe for the Book of Mormon and cousin to Joseph Smith, there was a serious conflict of interest in Oliver being a witness.</p></li></ul></li><li><p><strong>Second Sight:</strong></p><p>People believed they could see things as a vision in their mind. They called it “second sight.” We call it “imagination.” It made no difference to these people if they saw with their natural eyes or their spiritual eyes as they both were one and the same.</p><p>As mentioned previously, people believed they could see spirits and their dwelling places in the local hills along with seeing buried treasure deep in the ground. This supernatural way of seeing the world is also referred in Doctrine &amp; Covenants as “<a href=./local/www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.1.html#1 title="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/110.1?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>the eyes of our understanding</a>.”</p><p>If the plates and the experiences were real and tangible as 21<sup>st</sup> century Mormons are led to believe, why would the witnesses make the following kind of statements when describing the plates and the experience?</p><blockquote><p><strong>“While praying I passed into a state of entrancement, and in that state I saw the angel and the plates.”</strong> <small>— EMD 2:346-47</small></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>“I never saw the gold plates, only in a visionary or entranced state.”</strong> <small>— EMD 2:346-47</small></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>“He only saw the plates with a spiritual eye”</strong> <small>— Joseph Smith Begins His Work, Vol. 1, 1958</small></p></blockquote><blockquote><p><strong>“As shown in the vision”</strong> <small>— Zenas H.

And said that he never should have told that the testimony of the eight was false,</strong> if it had not been picked out of———[him/me?] but should have let it passed as it was…”<br><small>— Letter from Stephen Burnet to “Br. Johnson,” April 15, 1838, in Joseph Smith Letter Book, p. 2</small></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>The foreman in the Palmyra printing office that produced the first Book of Mormon said that Harris &quot;used to practice a good deal of his characteristic jargon and <strong>‘seeing with the spiritual eye,’ and the like.&quot;</strong><br>— <a href=./local/archive.org/stream/originriseprogre00tuck/originriseprogre00tuck_djvu.txt.html#maincontent title=https://ia600404.us.archive.org/15/items/originriseprogre00tuck/originriseprogre00tuck.pdf target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink><small>Mormonism: Its Origin, Rise, and Progress, p.71</small></a></p></blockquote><blockquote><p>Two other Palmyra residents said that Harris told them that he had seen the plates with <strong>“the eye of faith”</strong> or <strong>“spiritual eyes”</strong> — EMD 2:270 and 3:22</p></blockquote><blockquote><p>John H. Gilbert, the typesetter for most of the Book of Mormon, said that he had asked Harris, <strong>“Martin, did you see those plates with your naked eyes?”</strong> According to Gilbert, Harris <strong>“looked down for an instant, raised his eyes up, and said, `No, I saw them with a spiritual eye.”</strong> — EMD 2:548</p></blockquote><p>If these witnesses literally really saw the plates like everyone else on the planet sees tangible objects…why strange statements like, “I never saw them only as I see a city through a mountain”? What does that even mean? I’ve never seen a city through a mountain. Have you?</p><p>Why all these bizarre statements from the witnesses if the plates were real and the event literal? Why would you need a vision or supernatural power to see real, physical plates that Joseph said were in a box that he carried around? When Martin Harris was asked, “But did you see them [plates] with your natural, your bodily eyes, just as you see this pencil-case in my hand? Now say no or yes to this.” Martin answered, “I did not see them as I do that pencil-case, yet I saw them with the eye of faith; I saw them just as distinctly as I see anything around me, though at the time they were covered over with a cloth.”<br>— <a href=./local/books.google.com/NXzQAAAAMAAJ_406.html title=http://bit.ly/17E2FmG target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink><small>Origin and History of the Mormonites, p. 406</small></a></p><p>Why couldn’t Martin just simply answer “yes”?</p></li><li><p><strong>James Strang and the Voree Plates Witnesses:</strong></p><p></p><div style="text-align: center"><img src=./img/James_Strang.jpg alt="James Strang" class=boxed></div><p></p><p><a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Strang.html title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/James_Strang target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>James Strang</a> and his claims are absolutely fascinating. He was basically Joseph Smith 2.0—but with a twist. Like Joseph, Strang did the following:</p><ul><li>Claimed that he was visited by an angel who reserved plates for him to translate into the word of God. “The record which was sealed from my servant Joseph. Unto thee it is reserved.”</li><li>Received the “Urim and Thummim.”</li><li>Produced 11 witnesses who testified that they too had seen and inspected ancient metal plates.</li><li>Introduced new scripture. After unearthing the plates (the same plates as Laban from whom Nephi took the brass plates in Jerusalem), Strang translated it into scripture called the “<a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_the_Law_of_the_Lord.html title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Book_of_the_Law_of_the_Lord target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Book of the Law of the Lord</a>.”</li><li>Established a new Church: <a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter_Day_Saints_Strangite.html title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Church_of_Jesus_Christ_of_Latter_Day_Saints_(Strangite) target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>The Church of Jesus Christ of Latter Day Saints (Strangite)</a>. Its headquarters is still in Voree, Wisconsin.</li></ul><p>Like the Book of Mormon, the <em>Book of the Law of the Lord</em> has the testimony of its Witnesses in its preface:</p><blockquote><p></p><div style="text-align: center">TESTIMONY</div><p></p><p>Be it known unto all nations, kindreds, tongues and people, to whom this Book of the Law of the Lord shall come, that James J. Strang has the plates of the ancient Book of the Law of the Lord given to Moses, from which he translated this law, and has shown them to us. We examined them with our eyes, and handled them with our hands. The engravings are beautiful antique workmanship, bearing a striking resemblance to the ancient oriental languages; and those from which the laws in this book were translated are eighteen in number, about seven inches and three-eights wide, by nine inches long, occasionally embellished with beautiful pictures.</p><p>And we testify unto you all that the everlasting kingdom of God is established, in which this law shall be kept, till it brings in rest and everlasting righteousness to all the faithful.</p><p>SAMUEL GRAHAM,<br>SAMUEL P.

Wheelan, James M. Van Nostrand, and Edward Whitcomb, assembled at the call of James J. Strang, who is by us and many others approved as a Prophet and Seer of God. He proceeded to inform us that it had been revealed to him in a vision that an account of an ancient people was buried in a hill south of White River bridge, near the east line of Walworth County; and leading us to an oak tree about one foot in diameter, told us that we would find it enclosed in a case of rude earthen ware under that tree at the depth of about three feet; requested us to dig it up, and charged us to so examine the ground that we should know we were not imposed upon, and that it had not been buried there since the tree grew. The tree was surrounded by a sward of deeply rooted grass, such as is usually found in the openings, and upon the most critical examination we could not discover any indication that it had ever been cut through or disturbed.</p></li><li><p>We then dug up the tree, and continued to dig to the depth of about three feet, where we found a case of slightly baked clay containing three plates of brass. On one side of one is a landscape view of the south end of Gardner’s prairie and the range of hills where they were dug. On another is a man with a crown on his head and a scepter in his hand, above is an eye before an upright line, below the sun and moon surrounded with twelve stars, at the bottom are twelve large stars from three of which pillars arise, and closely interspersed with them are seventy very small stars. The other four sides are very closely covered with what appear to be alphabetic characters, but in a language of which we have no knowledge.</p></li><li><p>The case was found imbedded in indurated clay so closely fitting it that it broke in taking out, and the earth below the soil was so hard as to be dug with difficulty even with a pickax. Over the case was found a flat stone about one foot wide each way and three inches thick, which appeared to have undergone the action of fire, and fell in pieces after a few minutes exposure to the air. The digging extended in the clay about eighteen inches, there being two kinds of earth of different color and appearance above it.</p></li><li><p>We examined as we dug all the way with the utmost care, and we say, with utmost confidence, that no part of the earth through which we dug exhibited any sign or indication that it had been moved or disturbed at any time previous. The roots of the tree stuck down on every side very closely, extending below the case, and closely interwoven with roots from other trees. None of them had been broken or cut away. No clay is found in the country like that of which the case is made.</p></li><li><p>In fine, we found an alphabetic and pictorial record, carefully cased up, buried deep in the earth, covered with a flat stone, with an oak tree one foot in diameter growing over it, with every evidence that the sense can give that it has lain there as long as that tree has been growing.

This is how I presented the testimonies to investigators. According to the above manuscript that Oliver took to the printer for the Book of Mormon, they were not signatures. Since there is no evidence of any document whatsoever with the signatures of all of the witnesses, the only real testimonies we have from the witnesses are later interviews given by them and eyewitness accounts/affidavits made by others, some of which are shown previously.</p><p>From a legal perspective, the statements of the testimonies of the Three and Eight witnesses hold no credibility or weight in a court of law as there are a) no signatures of any of the witnesses except Oliver, b) no specific dates, c) no specific locations, and d) most of the witnesses made statements after the fact that contradict and cast doubt on the specific claims made in the statements contained in the preface of the Book of Mormon.</p></li><li><p><strong>Conclusion:</strong></p><ol><li><p>“The Witnesses never recanted or denied their testimonies”:</p><ul><li><p>Neither did James Strang’s witnesses; even after they were excommunicated from the church and estranged from Strang. Neither did dozens of Joseph Smith’s neighbors and peers who swore and signed affidavits on Joseph and his family’s characters. Neither did many of the Shaker witnesses who signed affidavits that they saw an angel on the roof top holding the “Sacred Roll and Book” written by founder Ann Lee. Same goes with the thousands of people over the centuries who claimed their entire lives to have seen the Virgin Mary and pointing to their experience as evidence that Catholicism is true.</p><p>There are also thousands of witnesses who never recanted their testimonies of seeing UFO’s, Big Foot, the Loch Ness Monster, Abominable Snowman, Aliens, and so on.</p><p>It doesn’t mean anything. People can believe in false things their entire lives and never recant. Just because they never denied or recanted does not follow that their experience and claims are true or that reality matches to what their perceived experience was.</p></li></ul></li><li><p>Problems:</p><ul><li><p>In discussing the witnesses, we should not overlook the primary accounts of the events they testified to. The official statements published in the Book of Mormon are not dated, signed (we have no record with their signatures except for Oliver’s), nor is a specific location given for where the events occurred. These are not eleven legally sworn affidavits but rather simple statements pre-written by Joseph Smith with claims of having been signed by three men and another by eight.</p></li><li><p>All of the Book of Mormon witnesses, excepting Martin Harris, were related by blood or marriage either with the Smiths or Whitmers. Oliver Cowdery (married to Elizabeth Ann Whitmer and cousin to Joseph Smith), Hiram Page (married to Catherine Whitmer), and the five Whitmers were related by marriage. Of course, Hyrum Smith, Samuel Smith, and Joseph Smith Sr. were Joseph’s brothers and father.</p><p>Mark Twain made light of this obvious problem:</p><blockquote><p>“…I could not feel more satisfied and at rest if the entire Whitmer family had testified.” <small>— <em>Roughing It,</em> p.107-115</small></p></blockquote></li><li><p>Within eight years, all of the Three Witnesses were excommunicated from the Church. This is what Joseph Smith said about them in 1838:</p><blockquote><p>“Such characters as…John Whitmer, David Whitmer, Oliver Cowdery, and Martin Harris, are too mean to mention; and we had liked to have forgotten them.” — <a href=./local/byustudies.byu.edu/content/volume-3-chapter-15.html#232 title=https://byustudies.byu.edu/hc/hcpgs/hc.aspx target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink><small>History of the Church Vol. 3, Ch. 15, p. 232</small></a></p></blockquote><p>This is what First Counselor of the First Presidency and once close associate Sidney Rigdon had to say about Oliver Cowdery:</p><blockquote><p>“…a lying, thieving, counterfeiting man who was ‘united with a gang of counterfeiters, thieves, liars, and blacklegs in the deepest dye, to deceive, cheat, and defraud the saints out of their property, by every art and stratagem which wickedness could invent…’”<br>— <a href=./local/www.olivercowdery.com/smithhome/1838Sent.htm title=http://www.olivercowdery.com/smithhome/1838Sent.htm target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink><small>February 15, 1841 Letter and Testimony</small></a><small>, p.6-9</small></p></blockquote><p>What does it say about the witnesses and their characters if even the Prophet and his counselor in the First Presidency thought they were questionable?</p></li><li><p>As mentioned in the above “Polygamy/Polyandry” section, Joseph was able to influence and convince many of the 31 witnesses to lie and perjure in a sworn affidavit that Joseph was not a polygamist. Is it outside the realm of possibility that Joseph was also able to influence or manipulate the experiences of his own magical thinking treasure digging family and friends as witnesses? Mormon men who already believed in second sight and who already believed that Joseph Smith was a true prophet of God?</p></li><li><p>If the Prophet Joseph Smith could get duped with the Kinderhook Plates thinking that the 19<sup>th</sup> century fake plates were a legitimate record of a “descendent of Ham,” how is having gullible guys like Martin Harris handling the covered gold plates going to prove anything?</p></li><li><p>James Strang’s claims and Voree Plates Witnesses are distinctive and more impressive compared to the Book of Mormon Witnesses:</p><ul><li>All of Strang’s witnesses were not related to one another through blood or marriage like the Book of Mormon Witnesses were.</li><li>Some of the witnesses were not members of Strang’s church.</li><li>The Voree Plates were displayed in a museum for both members and non-members to view and examine.</li><li>Strang provided 4 witnesses who testified that on his instructions, they actually dug the plates up for Strang while he waited for them to do so. They confirmed that the ground looked previously undisturbed.</li></ul></li><li><p>The Shakers and Ann Lee:</p><p></p><div style="text-align: center"><a href=./local/amhistory.si.edu/petersprints/lithograph_514169.html title="http://amhistory.si.edu/petersprints/lithograph.cfm?id=514169&amp;Category=music&amp;Results_Per=10&amp;search_all=false" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink><img src=./img/Shakers_Dancing.jpg alt="Shakers Dancing" class=boxed></a></div><p></p><p>The Shakers felt that “Christ has made his second appearance on earth, in a chosen female known by the name of Ann Lee, and acknowledged by us as our Blessed Mother in the work of redemption” (Sacred Roll and Book, p.358). The Shakers, of course, did not believe in the Book of Mormon, but they had a book entitled <em>A Holy, Sacred and Divine Roll and Book; From the Lord God of Heaven, to the Inhabitants of Earth.</em></p><p>More than 60 individuals gave testimony to the <em>Sacred Roll and Book,</em> which was published in 1843. Although not all of them mention angels appearing, some of them tell of many angels visiting them. One woman told of eight different visions.</p><p>Here is the testimony statement:</p><blockquote><p>We, the undersigned, hereby testify, that we saw the holy Angel standing upon the house-top, as mentioned in the foregoing declaration, holding the Roll and Book.</p><p class=largeLeftMargin><em>Betsey Boothe.</em><br><em>Louisa Chamberlain.</em><br><em>Caty De Witt.</em><br><em>Laura Ann Jacobs.</em><br><em>Sarah Maria Lewis.</em><br><em>Sarah Ann Spencer.</em><br><em>Lucinda McDoniels.</em><br><em>Maria Hedrick.</em></p></blockquote><p>Joseph Smith only had three witnesses who claimed to see an angel. The Shakers, however, had a large number of witnesses who claimed they saw angels and the Sacred Roll and Book. There are over a hundred pages of testimony from “Living Witnesses.” The evidence seems to show that Martin Harris accepted the Sacred Roll and Book as a divine revelation. Clark Braden stated: “Harris declared repeatedly that he had as much evidence for a Shaker book he had as for the Book of Mormon” (The Braden and Kelly Debate, p.173).</p><p>Why should we believe the Book of Mormon witnesses but not the Shakers witnesses? What are we to make of the reported Martin Harris comment that he had as much evidence for the Shaker book he had as for the Book of Mormon?</p></li></ul></li></ol></li></ol><p>In light of the James Strang/Voree Plates witnesses, the fact that all of the Book of Mormon Witnesses—except Martin Harris—were related to either Joseph Smith or David Whitmer, along with the fact that all of the witnesses were treasure hunters who believed in second sight, and in light of their superstitions and reputations…why would anyone gamble with their lives in believing in a book based on anything these men said or claimed or what’s written on the testimonies of the Witnesses page in the Book of Mormon?</p><p>The mistake that is made by 21<sup>st</sup> century Mormons is that they’re seeing the Book of Mormon Witnesses as empirical, rational, twenty-first century men instead of the nineteenth-century magical thinking, superstitious, and treasure digging men they were. They have ignored the peculiarities of their worldview, and by so doing, they misunderstand their experiences as witnesses.</p><p>At the end of the day? It all doesn’t matter. The Book of Mormon Witnesses and their testimonies of the gold plates are irrelevant. It does not matter whether eleven 19<sup>th</sup> century treasure diggers with magical worldviews saw some gold plates or not. It doesn’t matter because of this one simple fact:</p><blockquote><p><strong>Joseph did not use the gold plates for translating the Book of Mormon.</strong></p></blockquote><p></p><div style="text-align: center"><a href=./local/instagram.com/justanotherapostate.html title=https://instagram.com/justanotherapostate target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink><img src=./img/Just_Another_Apostate_Moroni_Meme.jpg alt="Just Another Apostate: Moroni Meme" class=boxed></a></div><p></p><h1><em>Temples &amp; Freemasonry</em> Concerns &amp; Questions:</h1><ol><li><p>Just seven weeks after <a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism_and_Freemasonry.html#Historical_connections title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mormonism_and_Freemasonry#Historical_connections target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Joseph’s Masonic initiation</a>, Joseph introduced the LDS endowment ceremony in <a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_Latter_Day_Saints.html#The_Nauvoo_endowment title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Endowment_(Latter_Day_Saints)#The_Nauvoo_Endowment target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>May 1842</a>.</p></li><li><p>President Heber C. Kimball, a Mason himself and a member of the First Presidency for 21 years, made the following statement:</p><blockquote><p>“We have the true Masonry. The Masonry of today is received from the apostasy which took place in the days of Solomon, and David. They have now and then a thing that is correct, but we have the real thing.”<br>— Stanley B. Kimball, Heber C. Kimball and Family: The Nauvoo Years, p.458</p></blockquote></li><li><p>If Masonry had the original temple ceremony but became distorted over time, why doesn’t the LDS ceremony more closely resemble an earlier form of Masonry, which would be more correct rather than the exact version that Joseph Smith was exposed to in his March 1842 Nauvoo, Illinois initiation?</p></li><li><p>Freemasonry has zero links to Solomon’s temple. Although more a Church folklore, with origins from comments made by early Mormon Masons such as Heber C. Kimball, than being Church doctrine, it’s a myth that the endowment ceremony has its origins from Solomon’s temple or that Freemasonry passed down parts of the endowment over the centuries from Solomon’s temple. Solomon’s temple was all about animal sacrifice. Freemasonry has its origins to stone tradesmen in medieval Europe—not in 950 BC Jerusalem. If there’s no connection to Solomon’s temple, what’s so divine about a man-made medieval European secret fraternity and its rituals?</p></li><li><p>Why did the Church remove the blood oath penalties and the 5 Points of Fellowship at the veil from the endowment ceremony in 1990? Both 100% Masonic rituals? What does this say about the Temple and the endowment ceremony if 100% pagan Masonic rituals were in it from its inception? What does it say about the Church if it removed something that Joseph Smith said he restored and which would never again be taken away from the earth?</p></li><li><p>Is God really going to require people to know secret tokens, handshakes, and signs to get into the Celestial Kingdom? If so, Masons, former Mormons, anti-Mormons, unworthy Mormons as well as non-Mormons who’ve seen the endowment on YouTube or read about the signs/handshakes/tokens online should pass through the pearly gates with flying colors.</p></li><li><p>Does the eternal salvation, eternal happiness, and eternal sealings of families really depend on medieval originated Masonic rituals in multi-million dollar castles? Is God really going to separate good couples and their children who love one other and who want to be together in the next life because they object to uncomfortable and strange Masonic temple rituals and a polygamous heaven?</p></li></ol><h1><em>Science</em> Concerns &amp; Questions:</h1><p>The problem Mormonism encounters is that so many of its claims are well within the realm of scientific study, and as such, can be proven or disproven.

It is scientifically established there has been life and death on this planet for billions of years.

Do you really literally believe in the flood story where 600-year-old Noah built a massive ark with dimensions that equate to about 450 feet long, 75 feet wide and 45 feet deep? That Noah and his very small family took two of each unclean creature and seven of every clean creature and all the food and fresh water that would be needed on board for 6 months? And that after the flood, Noah and his family released the animals and they, along with Noah’s family of eight repopulated—via incest—the entire planet?</p><p>Simple mathematics show that there was insufficient room on the ark to house all the animal species found on the planet, let alone the food required to feed all of them.</p><p>How did the carnivores survive? There would not have been nearly enough herbivores to sustain the carnivores during the voyage and the months after the ark landed. What would the herbivores eat after the flood subsided?</p><p>There are a bunch of other problems with the global flood and Noah’s ark story but I find it incredible that this is supposed to be taken literally considering the abundance of evidence against it.

But all the women children, that have not known a man by lying with him, keep alive for yourselves.” So they went back and did as Moses—the Lord’s prophet—commanded, killing everyone except for the virgins.

It is not a matter of the declaration of a policy <u>but of direct commandment from the Lord,</u> on which is founded the doctrine of the Church from the days of its organization, to the effect that Negroes may become members of the Church but that they are not entitled to the priesthood at the present time. <u>The prophets of the Lord have made several statements as to the operation of the principle. President Brigham Young said: `Why are so many of the inhabitants of the earth cursed with a skin of blackness? It comes in consequence of their fathers rejecting the power of the holy priesthood, and the law of God. They will go down to death. And when all the rest of the children have received their blessings in the holy priesthood, then that curse will be removed from the seed of Cain, and they will then come up and possess the priesthood, and receive all the blessings which we now are entitled to.’</u></p><p>President Wilford Woodruff made the following statement: ‘The day will come when all that race will be redeemed and possess all the blessings which we now have.’</p><p><u>The position of the Church regarding the Negro may be understood when another doctrine of the Church is kept in mind, namely, that the conduct of spirits in the premortal existence has some determining effect upon the conditions and circumstances under which these spirits take on mortality and that while the details of this principle have not been made known, the mortality is a privilege that is given to those who maintain their first estate; and that the worth of the privilege is so great that spirits are willing to come to earth and take on bodies no matter what the handicap may be as to the kind of bodies they are to secure; and that among the handicaps, failure of the right to enjoy in mortality the blessings of the priesthood is a handicap which spirits are willing to assume in order that they might come to earth. Under this principle there is no injustice whatsoever involved in this deprivation as to the holding of the priesthood by the Negroes.</u></p><p>The First Presidency&quot;</p></blockquote><p>Along with the above First Presidency statement, there are many other statements and explanations made by prophets and apostles clearly “justifying” the Church’s racism.

The fact that there are multiple conflicting First Vision accounts is not a useful truth? The fact that Joseph Smith was involved in Polyandry when D&amp;C 132:61 condemns it as “adultery” is not a useful truth?</p><p>He continues:</p><blockquote><p>“That historian or scholar who delights in pointing out the weaknesses and frailties of present or past leaders destroys faith. A destroyer of faith — particularly one within the Church, and more particularly one who is employed specifically to build faith — places himself in great spiritual jeopardy.”</p></blockquote><p>Right, because being honest to members about Joseph’s “weaknesses and frailties” of secretly marrying other men’s wives while denying and lying about it to everyone for 10+ years just might destroy faith. But let’s not teach this historical fact because “some things that are true are not very useful.”</p><p>What’s interesting about Packer’s above quote is that he’s focusing on history from the point of view that a historian is only interested in the “weaknesses and frailties of present and past leaders.” Historians are also interested in things like how the Book of Mormon got translated or how many accounts Joseph gave about the foundational First Vision or whether the Book of Abraham even matches the papyri and facsimiles.</p><p>Besides, it matters in the religious context what present and past leaders “weaknesses and frailties” are. If Joseph’s public position was that adultery and polygamy are morally wrong and condemned by God, what does it say about him and his character that he did exactly that in the dark while lying to Emma and everyone else about it? How is this not a useful truth? A relevant hypothetical example: President Monson gets caught with child pornography on his hard drive. This matters, especially in light of his current position, status, and teachings on morality. Just because a leader wears a religious hat does not follow that they’re exempt from history and accountability from others.</p><p>The question should not be whether it’s faith promoting or not to share ugly but truthful facts.

Is this member in need of repentance when he’s troubled by this inconsistency and deception? Is it the member’s fault for discovering the Book of Mormon translation deception still perpetuated by the Church? Why is the member required to repent for coming to the conclusion that something is very wrong?</p><p>Most of the information I discovered and confirmed online about the Church is found from Church friendly sources.

When we’re 14 million members? What a ridiculous accusation.” It was only after I lost my testimony and discovering, for the first time, the <a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strengthening_Church_Members_Committee.html title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Strengthening_Church_Members_Committee target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>SCMC</a> and the anti-intellectualism going on behind the scenes that I could clearly see the above cultish aspects of the Church and why people came to the conclusion that Mormonism is a cult.</p></li></ol><h1>Conclusion:</h1><blockquote><p>“Mormonism, as it is called, must stand or fall on the story of Joseph Smith. He was either a Prophet of God, divinely called, properly appointed and commissioned or he was one of the biggest frauds this world has ever seen. There is no middle ground. If Joseph was a deceiver, who willfully attempted to mislead people, then he should be exposed, his claims should be refuted, and his doctrines shown to be false…”<br></p><div style="text-align: center">— President Joseph Fielding Smith —</div><p></p></blockquote><p>When I first discovered that Joseph Smith used a rock in a hat to translate the Book of Mormon, that he was married to 11 other men’s wives, and that the Book of Abraham has absolutely nothing to do with the papyri or facsimiles…I went into a panic. I desperately needed answers and I needed them 3 hours ago. Among the first sources I looked to for answers were official Church sources such as Mormon.org and LDS.org. I couldn’t find them.</p><p>I then went to FairMormon and Neal Maxwell Institute (formerly FARMS).</p><p>FairMormon and these unofficial apologists have done more to destroy my testimony than any anti- Mormon source ever could. I found their version of Mormonism to be alien and foreign to the Chapel Mormonism that I grew up in attending Church, Seminary, reading Scriptures, General Conferences, EFY, mission, and BYU. Their answers are not only contradictory to the scriptures and teachings I learned through correlated Mormonism…they’re truly bizarre.</p><p>I was amazed to learn that, according to these unofficial apologists, translate doesn’t really mean translate, horses aren’t really horses (they’re <a href=./local/publications.mi.byu.edu/fullscreen/1055.html title="http://maxwellinstitute.byu.edu/publications/transcripts/?id=129" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>tapirs</a>), chariots aren’t really chariots (<a href=./local/or4uw7n.jpg title=http://i.imgur.com/or4uw7n.jpg target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>since tapirs can’t pull</a> chariots <a href=./local/en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronisms_in_the_Book_of_Mormon.html#Chariots_or_wheeled_vehicles title=https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Anachronisms_in_the_Book_of_Mormon#Chariots_or_wheeled_vehicles target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>without wheels</a>), steel isn’t really steel, Hill Cumorah isn’t really in New York (it’s possibly in Mesoamerica), Lamanites aren’t really the principal ancestors of the Native American Indians, marriage isn’t really marriage (if they’re Joseph’s marriages? They’re just mostly non-sexual spiritual sealings), and prophets aren’t really prophets (only when they’re heretics teaching today’s false doctrine).</p><p>Why is it that I had to first discover all of this — from the internet — at 31-years-old after 20 years of high activity in the Church? I wasn’t just a seat warmer at Church. I’ve read the scriptures several times. I’ve read hundreds of “approved” Church books. I was an extremely dedicated missionary who voluntarily asked to stay longer in the mission field. I was very interested in and dedicated to the gospel.</p><p>How am I supposed to feel about learning about these disturbing facts at 31-years-old? After making critical life decisions based on trust and faith that the Church was telling me the complete truth about its origins and history? After many books, seminary, EFY, Church history tour, mission, BYU, General Conferences, Scriptures, Ensigns, and regular Church attendance?</p><p>So, putting aside the absolute shock and feeling of betrayal in learning about all this information that has been kept concealed and hidden from me by the Church my entire life, I’m now expected to go back to the drawing board. Somehow, I’m supposed to rebuild my testimony on newly discovered information that is not only bizarre and alien to the Chapel Mormonism I had a testimony of; it’s almost comical.</p><p>I’m now supposed to believe that Joseph has the credibility of translating ancient records when the Book of Abraham and the Kinderhook Plates destroy this claim? That Joseph has the character and integrity to take him at his word after seeing his deliberate deception in hiding and denying polygamy and polyandry for at least 10 years of his adult life? How he backdated and retrofitted the Aaronic and Melchizedek Priesthood restoration events as if they were in the Book of Commandments all along? And I’m supposed to believe with a straight face that Joseph using a rock in a hat is totally legit? Despite this being the exact same method he used to con people out of their money during his treasure hunting days? Despite this ruining the official story of ancient prophets and Moroni investing all that time and effort into gold plates, which were not used because Joseph’s face was stuffed in a hat?</p><p>I’m supposed to sweep under the rug the inconsistent and contradictory First Vision accounts and just believe anyway? I’m supposed to believe that these men who have been wrong about so many important things and who have not prophesied, seered, or revealed much in the last 169 or so years are to be sustained as “prophets, seers, and revelators”?</p><p>I’m supposed to believe the scriptures have credibility after endorsing so much rampant immorality, violence, and despicable behavior? When it says that the earth is only 7,000 years old and that there was no death before then? Or that Heavenly Father is sitting on a throne with an erect penis when all evidence points to it really being the pagan Egyptian god of sex, Min? The “most correct book on earth” Book of Mormon going through over 100,000 changes over the years? After going through so many revisions and still being incorrect? Noah’s ark and the global flood are literal events? Tower of Babel is a literal event? The Book of Mormon containing 1769 King James Version edition translation errors and 1611 King James Version translators’ italics while claiming to be an ancient record?</p><p>That there’s actually a polygamous god who revealed a Warren Jeffs style revelation on polygamy that Joseph pointed to as a perverted license to secretly marry other living men’s wives and teenage girls barely out of puberty? That this crazy god actually threatened Joseph’s life with one of his angels with a sword if a newly married pregnant woman didn’t agree to Joseph’s marriage proposal? And like the part-time racist schizophrenic god, I’m supposed to believe in a god who was against polygamy before he was for polygamy but decided in 1890 that he was again against it?</p><p>I’m told to put these foundational problems on the shelf and wait until I die to get answers? To stop looking at the Church intellectually even though the “<a href=./local/www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.36.html#35 title="https://www.lds.org/scriptures/dc-testament/dc/93.36?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>glory of God is intelligence</a>”? Ignore and have faith anyway?</p><p>I’m sorry, but faith is believing and hoping when there is little evidence for or against something. Delusion is believing when there is an abundance of evidence against something. To me, it’s absolute insanity to bet my life, my precious time, my money, my heart, and my mind into an organization that has so many serious problematic challenges to its foundational truth claims.</p><p>There are just way too many problems. We’re not just talking about one issue here. We’re talking about dozens of serious issues that undermine the very foundation of the LDS Church and its truth claims.</p><p>The past year was the worst year of my life. I experienced a betrayal, loss, and sadness unlike anything I’ve ever known. “<a href=./local/www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/do-what-is-right.html title="https://www.lds.org/music/library/hymns/do-what-is-right?lang=eng" target=_blank rel=noopener data-offline-marker=cesletterLink>Do what is right; let the consequence follow</a>” now holds a completely different meaning for me.
