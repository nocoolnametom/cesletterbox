        <p>The CES LetterBox is a modification of the LibraryBox Project, which creates a small, portable wireless access point for delivering documents to people in areas without Internet access or where such access could be restricted.  It is a form of soft guerrilla activism, "soft" as it is entirely benign in character by being entirely opt-in but also "guerrilla" as it operates outside the reach of any restrictions that might be wished by Church leadership.</p>

<p>In short form, the CES LetterBox is a small, battery-powered wireless router (you'll have to supply your own router) that delivers, once you connect to it, a small collection of web pages, including an HTML version of the famous <a href="http://www.cesletter.com/">Letter to a CES Director</a>.  As the router is small enough to carry in a purse or pocket, and as it is illegal to suppress radio signals, you become a walking version of the CES Letter that can go anywhere.  The location is entirely up to you.  I don't personally think you should carry one into a place that would cause upset, but if you really wanted you could delver your WiFi network at Sacrament Meeting, at Stake Conference, at General Conference, at a BYU devotional, or even the locker room of your local Masonic lodge!</p>

<p>To begin the project, you'll need to get a wireless router (I'd recommend the <a href="https://amzn.com/B0088PPFP4">TP-Link TL-MR3040</a>), a small USB flash drive, and build a LibraryBox using the instructions found at the <a href="http://librarybox.us/buildingv2.1.php">LibraryBox website</a>.  The entire process should take around 20 minutes.</p>

<p>Once your LibraryBox is up and running, turn it off and take out the USB drive.  Download one of the following Zip files, unzip it, and replace the <code>LibraryBox/Content</code> directory on your USB stick wth the contents.  Then you can change the name of the wireless SSID (the network's name) by changing <code>LibraryBox/Config/ssid.txt</code> and put the USB stick back in and turn on the router.</p>

<p>You'll want to download either <code>cesletterbox.zip</code> <a href="https://github.com/nocoolnametom/cesletterbox/releases/download/v1.0.0/cesletterbox.zip">(3.46 MB)</a> which have only the files needed to display just the CES Letter itself, or <code>cesletterbox_full.zip</code> <a href="https://github.com/nocoolnametom/cesletterbox/releases/download/v1.0.0/cesletterbox_full.zip">(322 MB)</a> which contains offline versions of most of the links contained in the CES Letter so that readers can enjoy a better context for the content of the letter.</p>

<p>And just like that you're up and running!</p>

<p>You can also add your own files that you want to share in the <code>LibraryBox/Shared</code> directories.</p>
